# The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal
# ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and
# tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing.
# Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from
# your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for
# the meal including both the tax and the tip. Format the output so that all of the values
# are displayed using two decimal places.

##
# Compute the tax and tip for a restaurant meal
#

# My local tax rate is 5%. In Python we represent 5% and 18% as 0.05 and 0.18 respectively
TAX_RATE = 0.1
TIP_RATE = 0.18

# Read the cost of the meal from the user
cost = float(input("Enter the cost of the meal: "))

# Compute the tax and the tip
tax = cost * TAX_RATE
tip = cost * TIP_RATE
total = cost + tax + tip

#Display the result
print("The tax is %.2f and the tip is %.2f, making the total %.2f" % \
      (tax,tip,total))

# The \ at the end of the line is called the line continuation character.
# It tells Python that the statement continues on the next time
# Do not include any spaces or tabs after the \ character
