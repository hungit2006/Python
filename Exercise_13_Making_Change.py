# Consider the software that runs on a self-checkout machine. One task that it must be
# able to perform is to determine how much change to provide when the shopper pays
# for a purchase with cash.
# Write a program that begins by reading a number of cents from the user as an
# integer. Then your program should compute and display the denominations of the
# coins that should be used to give that amount of change to the shopper. The change
# should be given using as few coins as possible. Assume that the machine is loaded
# with pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, loonies and toonies.

# A one dollar coin was introduced in Canada in 1987. It is referred to as a
# loonie because one side of the coin has a loon (a type of bird) on it. The two
# dollar coin, referred to as a toonie, was introduced 9 years later. Itâ€™s name is
# derived from the combination of the number two and the name of the loonie.

# Compute the minimum collection of coins needed to represent a number of cents.

# the amount of change that still needs to be considered by
# computing the remainder after dividing by 200
