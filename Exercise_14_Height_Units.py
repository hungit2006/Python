# Many people think about their height in feet and inches, even in some countries that
# primarily use the metric system. Write a program that reads a number of feet from
# the user, followed by a number of inches. Once these values are read, your program
# should compute and display the equivalent number of centimeters.

# Hint: One foot is 12 inches. One inch is 2.54 centimeters.

##
# Convert a height in feet and inches to centimeters
#
IN_PER_FT = 12
CM_PER_IN = 2.54

# Read input from the user
print("Enter your height: ")
feet = int(input("Number of feet: "))
inches = int(input("Number of inches: "))

# Compute the equvalent number of centimeters
cm = (feet * IN_PER_FT + inches) * CM_PER_IN

#Display the result
print("Your height in centimeters is: ", cm, "cm")
